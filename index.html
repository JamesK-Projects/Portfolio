            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I'm James, a Software Developer based out of Salt Lake City, UT. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, but I recently made the switch to being a full-time Software Developer and I love what I do!</p>
            <p>I specialize in creating full-stack interactive apps and websites. As a new developer, I'm always eager to take on new projects and learn new things along the way! </p>
            <p>Please take a look at some of the <a href="#portfolio">apps</a> that I've created, and let me know what you think!</p>

            <div class="item-double">
              <p>After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I worked as a Systems Engineer on a large construction project. However, I knew I had a great interest in programming, and after dabbling in the coding world, I decided it was something I wanted to pursue further. </p>
              <p>I am currently enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Thinkful, and I'm excited to grow my skills as a Software Developer! As a new developer, I love working with others to get different perspectives and ideas. Though coding is difficult, learning to embrace the challenges has helped me appreciate those AHA! moments when everything finally comes together.</p>
              <p>When I'm not programming, you might find me outside enjoying one of my many outdoor hobbies, including hiking, camping, playing ultimate frisbee, and walking my dog, among others. My passion for the outdoors has led me to travel the country in a self-converted camper van for a year, where I was able to see countless beautiful sights. Towards the end of my travels, I quickly fell in love with Utah and ultimately decided to make Salt Lake City my home!</p>
              <p>As a full-stack developer, my services include building quick and responsive websites and apps from the ground up. Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a> if you would like to know more about what I can do for you!
