            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>I'm James, a Software Developer based out of Salt Lake City, UT. I have a background in Mechanical Engineering, but I made the switch to being a full-time Software Developer and I love what I do!</p>
            <p>With almost 3 years of full-stack experience at ExecOnline, I've familiarized myself with current technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Ruby on Rails to create high-quality features and products. There's so much to learn in this industry, and I'm always eager to take on new projects and learn new things along the way! </p>
            <p>Please take a look at some of the <a href="#portfolio">apps</a> that I've created, and let me know what you think!</p>

            <div class="item-double">
              <p>After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I worked as a Systems Engineer on a large construction project. However, I knew I had a great interest in programming, and after dabbling in the coding world, I decided it was something I wanted to pursue further. </p>
              <p>In 2021 I enrolled in the Software Engineering program at Thinkful, where I learned how to create my first web apps using JavaScript, React, and CSS. After graduating from the program, I landed a Fullstack Engineering job at ExecOnline where I was able to put my new skills to the test. I spent my time there creating robust features for their online Leadership Development platform, allowing me to gain confidence in my coding abilities (as well as my ability to Google things!). </p>
              <p>After almost 3 years at ExecOnline, I am excited to challenge myself with a new Software Engineering role where I can grow my skills even further!</p>
              <p>When I'm not programming, you might find me outside enjoying one of my many outdoor hobbies, including hiking, camping, playing ultimate frisbee, and walking my dog, among others. My passion for the outdoors has led me to travel the country in a self-converted camper van for a year, where I was able to see countless beautiful sights. Towards the end of my travels, I quickly fell in love with Utah and ultimately decided to make Salt Lake City my home!</p>
              <p>I'm eager to connect about any potential opportunities! Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a> if you would like to know more about what I can do for you!
